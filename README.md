# React-php-Mysql-web-apps
This project is created to implement a web application using React-php-Mysql  

## Get Started 

### Step 1)
#### Php and Mysql environnement

-Ensure that you have apache running on port 80, I recommend using MAMP/WAMP üêò or equivalent for a GUI interface
-Add a folder  to WWW Appache folder, name it 'challenge'and place into it 'modele, controller, includes' which are in 'PHP'
-import the Shops database (using the file shops.sql) with phpmyadmin 

### Step 2) üñåÔ∏è
#### Install dependencies

install create-react-app globally:
```
npm install -g create-react-app
```

Create new project for in your Documents:
```
create-react-app reactPhp
cd reactPhp/
npm start
```
Open localhost:3000 in your browser to see basic react app in action. (make sur react is running on this port !!)
Now that we are done with setup process lets add to it our specific react files
for that copy all files placed in React folder to reactPhp

after that add "react-router-dom " module to reactPhp project for doing redirection between our component and Links
```
npm i react-router-dom
```

### Step 3) üñºÔ∏è

#### Now we need to implement and manage shops 
that's will be done soon
